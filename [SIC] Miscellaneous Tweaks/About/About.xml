	<description> Incorporates a variety of small patches that address balance issues, weird design choices and other bugbears. Includes:
 - Wield Without Violence: Non-violent pawns can equip weapons, even though they can't use them to attack.
 - Ideology Apparel: Buffs or tweaks many useless items to try give them a niche, rather than being strictly inferior or identical to a basegame item.
 - Turret Adjustments: Makes turrets, especially Autocannons and Uranium Slug Turrets, a lot more powerful, but a lot more expensive to operate.
 - Ideology Seating: Tweaks the beauty of Pews and Kneel Sheets to make them vaguely comparable with Kneel Pillows.
 - Ideology Flooring: Makes steel flooring (Spikecore Plates and Hex Tiles) cleaner, but also more work-expensive.
 - Drape Rendering Patch: Makes Drapes render  on the same layer as columns rather than rendering over the top of tall objects placed in front of them.
 - Merge Pots: Removes Bonsai Pots from the game, but allows Bonsai Trees to be planted in Plant Pots (if Tree Sowing has been researched.)
- Draw Infestation Numbers: when the Draw Infestation Chance debug option is selected, the beauty drawer draws infestation score instead of beauty.
